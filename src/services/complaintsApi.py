"""
ðŸ“¢ Complaints API (Simulated 311 System)

Note:
Many cities (like in the US) have official 311 complaint systems, 
but there is no global free API for city-wide complaints. 

To showcase how CityPulse 360Â° could integrate public complaint 
data, this endpoint simulates complaints (roads, electricity, 
garbage, etc.) with random categories, statuses, and timestamps. 

This acts as a placeholder for real 311/Open311 APIs or city 
government datasets that can be integrated later.
